= STREAMING =

* faster seeks
* is there any way to tell (s)mplayer about the duration of the stream?
* is there any way to make smplayer correctly position the lever on the seek bar?
  * might be a good idea to used correct HTTP 206 answers...
* pre-re-compress on the server (server-side caching) and display progress in WEB UI
* support DLNA? (https://github.com/geuma/pDLNA)
  * added externals support to pDLNA (@ https://github.com/jjYBdx4IL/pDLNA), such that
    it can connect to http://ip:3001/playback via an external command.
  * discovered that Panasonic TX-L37GT24 *can* stream mpegts(h264+mp3) via DLNA.

= WEB UI =

* automatic restore of player when WEB UI is (re)loaded while streaming is in progress.
* make bit rates configurable via WEB UI. store them in cookies?
* remember last play position/last active recording via cookie?
* detect bandwidth problems? auto-adjust bit rates?
* use secure JSON deocding mechanism instead of "eval".

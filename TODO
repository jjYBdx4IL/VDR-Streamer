= STREAMING =

* faster seeks
* is there any way to tell (s)mplayer about the duration of the stream?
* is there any way to make smplayer correctly position the lever on the seek bar?
* pre-re-compress on the server (server-side caching) and display progress in WEB UI

= WEB UI =

* automatic restore of player when WEB UI is (re)loaded while streaming is in progress.
* play controls, ie. +/- 10 seconds/1 minute/10 minutes; display of current time position
  (derived from VDR recording position, which is of course, always a bit early...)
* seeking: how can we handle the delay arising due to the fact that we only have control
  over feeding VDR recording as input to ffmpeg better? Idea: ad-hoc high-density
  thumbnail generation. Clicking a thumbnail will seek directly to that position, thereby
  eliminating the need to do multiple seeks in order to search for the correct position.
  Or even better: create a mini-flash-preview of the whole stream?
* make bit rates configurable via WEB UI. store them in cookies?
* remember last play position/last active recording via cookie?
* detect bandwidth problems? auto-adjust bit rates?
